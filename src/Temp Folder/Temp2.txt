UltimateStarCoder: how go connect to mssql

GitHub Copilot: To connect to Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) from a Node.js application, you can use the `mssql` package. Here's how you can modify the provided code to use MSSQL instead of MySQL:

1. Install the `mssql` package using npm or yarn.
2. Import the `mssql` package in your code.
3. Configure the connection to your MSSQL database.
4. Use the connection to query the database.

Here's an example based on your code snippet:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const sql = require('mssql');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, world!');
});

// MSSQL database configuration
const

 config

 = {
    user: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password',
    server: 'localhost', // You can use 'localhost\\instance' to connect to named instance
    database: 'your_database',
    options: {
        encrypt: true, // Use this if you're on Windows Azure
        trustServerCertificate: true // Use this if you have self-signed certificates
    }
};

// Connect to your database
sql.connect(config, function (err) {
    if (err) console.log(err);

    // Create Request object to perform queries
    var request = new sql.Request();

    // Query your database here
});

const port = 3001;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Remember to replace `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, `'localhost'`, and `'your_database'` with your actual database credentials and server details. Also, adjust the `encrypt` and `trustServerCertificate` options based on your server's configuration.

UltimateStarCoder: how to create a user and password

GitHub Copilot: To create a user and password in a MySQL database, you typically use SQL commands. This process involves connecting to your MySQL server using a MySQL client or through a script in a programming language that supports MySQL connections, like PHP, Python, or Node.js.

Here's a step-by-step guide in pseudocode:

1. Connect to the MySQL server as the root user or another user with sufficient privileges to create new users.
2. Use the `CREATE USER` statement to create a new user.
3. Use the `ALTER USER` statement to set a password for the new user.
4. Optionally, grant privileges to the new user using the `GRANT` statement.

Below is how you could do it using the MySQL command line:

```sql
-- Connect to the MySQL server as root




mysql -u root -p

-- Create a new user
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

-- Grant privileges to the new user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Replace `'newuser'` and `'password'` with your desired username and password. The `@'localhost'` part specifies that this user will connect from the local machine. Adjust this as necessary for your setup.

If you're looking to do this within a Node.js application (as your active file suggests you might be working with Node.js), you would first connect to your MySQL database using an administrative account and then execute these SQL statements using the `mysql` package's methods. However, managing user accounts and permissions directly from an application is uncommon and typically handled manually by a database administrator or through initial setup scripts due to the sensitive nature of these operations.

UltimateStarCoder: how to create database user for mssql

GitHub Copilot: To create a database user for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) from within a Node.js application using the `mssql` package, you would typically execute SQL commands similar to those you would run in a SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL client. However, it's important to note that creating users and managing permissions are sensitive operations usually performed by a database administrator directly in the database or through initial setup scripts, not through application code in production environments.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you could theoretically do it, assuming you have the necessary permissions:

1. **Connect to the MSSQL Database**: Use the `mssql` package to connect to your database.
2. **Execute SQL Commands to Create User**: Use the `CREATE LOGIN` statement to create a new login at the server level, and then use the `CREATE USER` statement to create a user for this login in the specific database. You may also need to use the `ALTER ROLE` statement to add the user to roles.

Here's an example in Node.js:

```javascript
const sql = require('mssql');

// MSSQL database configuration
const config = {
    user:

 '

admin_username',
    password: 'admin_password',
    server: 'localhost', // You can use 'localhost\\instance' to connect to named instance
    database: 'master', // Connect to the master database to create a new login
    options: {
        encrypt: true, // Use this if you're on Windows Azure
        trustServerCertificate: true // Use this if you have self-signed certificates
    }
};

async function createUser() {
    try {
        // Connect to your database
        await sql.connect(config);

        // Create a new login at the server level
        await sql.query`CREATE LOGIN newLogin WITH PASSWORD = 'newPassword'`;
        
        // Switch to the target database
        await sql.query`USE yourDatabase`;

        // Create a user for the new login in the target database
        await sql.query`CREATE USER newUser FOR LOGIN newLogin`;

        // Optionally, add the user to a role
        await sql.query`ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER newUser`;

        console.log('User created successfully');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to create user:', err);
    }
}

createUser();
```

Replace `'admin_username'`, `'admin_password'`, `'newLogin'`, `'newPassword'`, `'yourDatabase'`, and `'newUser'` with your actual administrative credentials, the new login name, the new login's password, your target database, and the new user name, respectively.

**Important**: Directly managing database security from application code can introduce security risks. Ensure that any such code is tightly controlled and not exposed to unauthorized users. In production environments, it's best to handle these tasks outside of the application lifecycle.

The [`server`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "src/server.js") field in the [`config`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "src/server.js") object should contain the hostname or IP address of the SQL Server, not a URL with a port like `http://localhost:3001/`. The port `3001` is typically used for web servers (like an Express.js server), not for SQL Server instances. SQL Server instances usually listen on port `1433` by default unless configured otherwise.

Here's a corrected version of your configuration, assuming your SQL Server is running on the default port on `localhost`:

```javascript
const sql = require('mssql');

// MSSQL database config




const config = {
  user: 'crud_admin',
  password: 'crud_app_2024',
  server: 'localhost', // Use the hostname or IP address of the SQL Server
  database: 'crud_app',
  options: {
    encrypt: true, // For Windows Azure, set to true. For others, it depends on your setup.
    trustServerCertificate: true // Only set to true for development purposes
  }
}

async function main() {
  try {
    // Connect to the database
    await sql.connect(config);
    console.log('Connected to the database');
  }
  catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
};
```

Make sure to adjust the `encrypt` and `trustServerCertificate` options based on your specific environment and security requirements. The `trustServerCertificate` option is particularly important; setting it to `true` without understanding the implications can expose you to man-in-the-middle attacks. In a production environment, you should have a valid certificate and set `encrypt` to `true` for secure communication.

UltimateStarCoder: how to start your mssql server

GitHub Copilot: To start your SQL Server on a Windows machine, you can use the SQL Server Configuration Manager or services.msc. On Linux, you would typically use the `systemctl` command. Here's how you can do it on both systems:

### Windows

1. **Using SQL Server Configuration Manager**:
   - Open SQL Server Configuration Manager.
   - Navigate to SQL Server Services.
   - Right-click on your SQL Server instance (e.g., SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)).
   - Click Start.

2. **Using Services**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.
   - Find the SQL Server service (e.g., SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)).
   - Right-click it and select Start.

### Linux

On Linux, SQL Server runs as a service. You can start it with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mssql-server
```

### Verify SQL Server is Running

- **Windows**: In SQL Server Configuration Manager or services.msc, the status of the SQL Server service should show as Running.
- **Linux**: You can check the status of the service with `sudo systemctl status mssql-server`.

### Note

- The service name `mssql-server` is used by default on Linux. On Windows, the default instance is named `SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)`, while named instances follow the pattern `SQL Server (YourInstanceName)`.
- If you're unable to start SQL Server, check the error logs for more information. On Windows, these are typically found in the SQL Server installation directory under the `Log` folder. On Linux, you can find them at `/var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog`.

UltimateStarCoder: I am using mac M1

GitHub Copilot: Given the information and considering you're using a Mac M1, there are a few adjustments and clarifications needed for your setup:

1. **SQL Server Connection Configuration**: The [`server`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "src/server.js") field in your configuration should not include a port when connecting to SQL Server unless you're specifying a non-default port that SQL Server is listening on. The default port for SQL Server is 1433. If SQL Server is running on a different machine or if you're using a named instance that doesn't use the default port, you would need to specify it. However, the format `localhost:3001` is typically used for web servers, not SQL Server instances. Ensure your SQL Server instance is correctly set up and accessible from your Mac.

2. **Options Field**: The [`options`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "src/server.js") field in your configuration has [`encrypt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "src/server.js") and [`trustedServerConnection`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "src/server.js"). The correct option for trusting the server's certificate in the `mssql` package is `trustServerCertificate`, not [`trustedServerConnection`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "src/server.js"). This is important if you're connecting to a server with a self-signed certificate, especially in development environments.

3. **Running SQL Server on Mac M1**: SQL Server does not natively run on macOS. You would typically use Docker to run SQL Server on a Mac. Ensure you have Docker installed and have pulled the SQL Server image and run it as a container. Here's a basic command to start a SQL Server container:

   ```bash
   docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=yourStrong(!)Password' -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
   ```

   Replace `yourStrong(!)Password` with your actual password. This command pulls the SQL Server 2019 image and runs it. The `-p 1433:1433` maps the default SQL Server port from the container to your host, making it accessible via `localhost:1433`.

4. **Connecting to SQL Server from Node.js on Mac M1**: After setting up SQL Server in Docker, ensure your `config` object in `server.js` is correctly pointing to `localhost` (or the Docker container's IP if you're using Docker Toolbox) and using the correct port if not the default. Also, adjust the `options` to correctly reflect your environment's needs.

Here's an updated version of your config considering the above points:

```javascript


const

 config = {
  user: 'crud_admin',
  password: 'crud_app_2024',
  server: 'localhost', // Assuming SQL Server is running on the default port 1433
  database: 'crudDatabase',
  options: {
    encrypt: true, // For Docker-based SQL Server on Mac, this might need to be true
    trustServerCertificate: true // Correct option to trust the server certificate
  }
}
```

Ensure your SQL Server instance (in Docker) is running and accessible before attempting to connect from your Node.js application.

UltimateStarCoder: give me an example of a SQL server insance

GitHub Copilot: Given the context of your setup and the need to correct the configuration for connecting to a SQL Server instance, especially on a Mac M1 using Docker, here's an example of how you might set up and reference a SQL Server instance:

### Step 1: Pull and Run SQL Server Docker Image

First, ensure Docker is installed on your Mac. Then, pull and run the SQL Server Docker image. Open a terminal and execute:

```bash
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong(!)Password' -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
```

- `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` confirms your acceptance of the End-User Licensing Agreement.
- `SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong(!)Password` sets the database system administrator (sa) password. Replace `YourStrong(!)Password` with a strong password of your choice.
- `-p 1433:1433` maps port 1433 from the container to port 1433 on your host, making the SQL Server instance accessible via `localhost:1433`.
- `--name sqlserver` names your container `sqlserver`.
- `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest` specifies the Docker image to use, in this case, the latest SQL Server 2019 image.

### Step 2: Correct the Configuration in `server.js`

Adjust your `config` object in `server.js` to correctly connect to this SQL Server instance:

```javascript


const

 config = {
  user: 'sa', // Default system administrator account
  password: 'YourStrong(!)Password', // The password you set above
  server: 'localhost', // Connect to SQL Server running in Docker on localhost
  database: 'crudDatabase',
  options: {
    encrypt: true, // Required for Azure SQL. For local Docker-based SQL, it depends on your setup.
    trustServerCertificate: true // Trust the self-signed certificate if using one
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Use the Configuration

With the Docker container running and your configuration adjusted, your [`createUser`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "src/server.js") function should be able to connect to the SQL Server instance when invoked.

### Note

- Ensure the SQL Server Docker container is running before attempting to connect.
- The [`server`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "src/server.js") field in the [`config`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "src/server.js") object should not include a port when using the default port (1433). If you map SQL Server to a different port on your host, you would specify it here.
- The [`user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "src/server.js") in the corrected configuration is set to `sa`, the default system administrator account for SQL Server. Ensure you use the correct user account and password that matches your SQL Server setup.

This setup provides a basic example of running a SQL Server instance in Docker and connecting to it from a Node.js application on a Mac M1.

UltimateStarCoder: how can I setup my mssql server correctly?

GitHub Copilot: To set up your MSSQL server correctly, especially considering the configuration in your [`server.js`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/mac-rufusumeokolo/Documents/VSCode/crud_app/src/server.js") file, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install SQL Server

Ensure SQL Server is installed on your machine. If you're on a Mac, you'll likely be using Docker to run SQL Server, as SQL Server itself does not run natively on macOS.

### Step 2: Run SQL Server in Docker

1. **Pull the SQL Server Docker Image**: Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
   ```

2. **Run the SQL Server Container**: Start an instance of the Docker image you just pulled:

   ```bash
   docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong(!)Password' -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
   ```

   Replace `YourStrong(!)Password` with a strong password.

   Note: The `-p 1433:1433` option maps port 1433 from the container to port 1433 on your host. This is the default SQL Server port. If you want to use a different port (like `3001` as in your config), you would adjust this accordingly.

### Step 3: Create the Database and User

1. **Access the SQL Server Command Line**: Connect to your Docker container's bash shell:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it sqlserver /bin/bash
   ```

2. **Launch SQLCMD**: Inside the container, connect to SQL Server using the `sqlcmd` tool:

   ```bash
   /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'YourStrong(!)Password'
   ```

3. **Create the Database**: Once in `sqlcmd`, create your database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE crudDatabase;
   GO
   ```

4. **Create a User**: Still in `sqlcmd`, create a user for your application:

   ```sql
   USE crudDatabase;
   CREATE LOGIN crud_admin WITH PASSWORD = 'crud_app_2024';
   CREATE USER crud_admin FOR LOGIN crud_admin;
   ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER crud_admin;
   GO
   ```

### Step 4: Adjust Your Application Configuration

Given your current setup, you need to adjust the [`server`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "src/server.js") field in your [`config`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmac-rufusumeokolo%2FDocuments%2FVSCode%2Fcrud_app%2Fsrc%2Fserver.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "src/server.js") object to match the port you've exposed from Docker. If you've used the default SQL Server port (`1433`), ensure your config reflects this:

```javascript
const config

 =

 {
  user: 'crud_admin',
  password: 'crud_app_2024',
  server: 'localhost', // Ensure this matches the Docker port mapping
  database: 'crudDatabase',
  options: {
    encrypt: true,
    trustedServerConnection: false // This should likely be false unless you have specific configurations
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Connect from Your Application

With the database and user set up, and your application configuration adjusted, you should be able to connect to your SQL Server instance from your application using the `createUser` function.

### Note

- Ensure Docker is running before attempting to connect.
- Adjust the `encrypt` and `trustedServerConnection` options based on your specific requirements and environment. For local development, you might not need `encrypt` set to `true`, and `trustedServerConnection` might not be applicable.
- If you're using a different port than `1433`, make sure to update the port in your Docker command and your application's configuration accordingly.

zsh: command not found: docker

GitHub Copilot: The error message `zsh: command not found: docker` indicates that Docker is not installed on your Mac, or it's not properly added to your system's PATH. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Docker

1. **Download Docker for Mac**: Go to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/) and download the Docker Desktop application for Mac.
2. **Install Docker Desktop**: Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag the Docker icon to your Applications folder. Follow the installation instructions.
3. **Launch Docker Desktop**: Open Docker from your Applications folder. The first time you open Docker, it might ask for your system password. Docker needs privileged access to work with the system's networking components.

### Step 2: Verify Installation

After installing Docker Desktop, ensure it's running by looking for the Docker icon in your menu bar. Docker needs to be running for you to use Docker commands in the terminal.

1. **Open a Terminal**: You can use Terminal, iTerm, or any other terminal application you prefer.
2. **Verify Docker Installation**: Type the following command and press Enter:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

   This command should return the version of Docker installed, indicating that Docker is correctly installed and accessible from your terminal.

### Step 3: Retry Pulling the Docker Image

With Docker installed and running, retry the command to pull the MSSQL Server Docker image:

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
```

This command downloads the latest SQL Server 2019 image from Microsoft's repository on Docker Hub.

### Additional Tips

- **Docker Permissions**: If you encounter permissions issues, ensure your user account is added to the Docker group, or you might need to use `sudo` before Docker commands (though this is less common on Mac).
- **Docker Desktop Settings**: You can adjust Docker's resource allocation (like CPU and memory) through Docker Desktop's settings if you're planning to run resource-intensive containers.
- **Keep Docker Running**: Docker Desktop must be running whenever you want to use Docker commands or run Docker containers.

UltimateStarCoder: mac-rufusumeokolo@Mac-Rufuss-MacBook-Pro crud_app % docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=StrongPW2024(!)' -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

GitHub Copilot: The warning message you're seeing indicates that the Docker image's architecture (`linux/amd64`) does not match your host's architecture (`linux/arm64/v8`). This is common when running Docker on newer Macs with Apple Silicon (M1/M2 chips) which use the ARM architecture, while many Docker images are built for AMD64 (x86_64) architecture.

To proceed, you have a couple of options:

### Option 1: Use the `--platform` Flag

You can explicitly specify the platform for the Docker image you want to run. Docker Desktop for Mac with Apple Silicon can run containers based on Linux/AMD64 in emulation. To pull and run the image for the `amd64` platform, use the `--platform` flag:

```bash
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD

=

StrongPW2024(!)' -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d --platform linux/amd64 mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
```

This command tells Docker to emulate the AMD64 architecture for this container. Performance might be slightly impacted due to emulation, but for development purposes, it's usually acceptable.

### Option 2: Look for an ARM64 Image

As of my last update, Microsoft had not published an official ARM64 (aarch64) version of SQL Server for Linux. If you're using other services or databases, you might find ARM64 versions available, which would run natively without emulation. For SQL Server, however, emulation via the `--platform` flag is currently the way to go.

### Adjusting Your Application Configuration

After successfully starting your SQL Server container, remember to adjust your application's database configuration if necessary. Based on the excerpt from `server.js`, you should update the `server` field in your `config` object to match the SQL Server's address and port. Since you're using the default port (`1433`), and if the SQL Server is running locally, your current configuration should work. However, ensure the `server` field does not include the port if it's the default port:

```javascript
const config = {
  user: 'crud_admin',
  password: 'crud_app_2024',
  server: 'localhost', // Remove the port if using the default port
  database: 'crudDatabase',
  // options as needed
}
```

This adjustment ensures your application can connect to the SQL Server instance running in Docker.
